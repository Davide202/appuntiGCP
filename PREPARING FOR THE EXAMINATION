Load balancing

HTTP Load Balancer
quando hai più servizi identici (instance group) o server cluster,
che devono funzionare come singola risorsa.

Load Balancer può anche essere configurato per 
aggiungere o rimuovere servers o server clusters (Autoscaling).

	Global HTTP(S) LB		can route differente URLs to differente backends
	Global SSL Proxy LB		supported on specific port numbers
	Global TCP Proxy LB		supported on specific port numbers
	
	Regional LB				supported on any port number
	Regional internal LB	use for the internal tiers of multi-tier applications

SSL: Secure Sockets Layer
Transport Layer Security (TLS), the successor of the now-deprecated Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
TCP: Transmission Control Protocol

LAB - Setting Up Network and HTTP Load Balancers [ACE]

In this hands-on lab, you'll learn the differences between a network load balancer and a HTTP load balancer, and how to set them up for your applications running on Google Compute Engine virtual machines.

There are several ways you can load balance in Google Cloud Platform. This lab takes you through the setup of the following load balancers:

L4 Network Load Balancer
L7 HTTP(s) Load Balancer
Students are encouraged to type the commands themselves, which helps in learning the core concepts. Many labs include a code block that contains the required commands. You can easily copy and paste the commands from the code block into the appropriate places during the lab.

What you'll do
-Setup a network load balancer.

-Setup a HTTP(s) load balancer.

Get hands-on experience learning the differences between network load balancers and HTTP load balancers.

+Set the default region and zone for all resources
In Cloud Shell, set the default zone:

>gcloud config set compute/zone us-central1-a

Set the default region:

>gcloud config set compute/region us-central1

Note: When you run gcloud on your own machine, the config settings persist across sessions. In Cloud Shell you need to set this for every new session or reconnection.

+Create multiple web server instances

To simulate serving from a cluster of machines, create a simple cluster of Nginx web servers to serve static content using Instance Templates and Managed Instance Groups. Instance Templates define the look of every virtual machine in the cluster (disk, CPUs, memory, etc). Managed Instance Groups instantiate a number of virtual machine instances using the Instance Template.

To create the Nginx web server clusters, create the following:

A startup script to be used by every virtual machine instance to setup Nginx server upon startup
An instance template to use the startup script
A target pool
A managed instance group using the instance template
Still in Cloud Shell, create a startup script to be used by every virtual machine instance. This script sets up the Nginx server upon startup:

cat << EOF > startup.sh
#! /bin/bash
apt-get update
apt-get install -y nginx
service nginx start
sed -i -- 's/nginx/Google Cloud Platform - '"\$HOSTNAME"'/' /var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html
EOF

oppure

> nano startup.sh

apt-get update
apt-get install -y nginx
service nginx start
sed -i -- 's/nginx/Google Cloud Platform - '"\$HOSTNAME"'/' /var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html

Create an instance template, which uses the startup script:

> gcloud compute instance-templates create nginx-template \
         --metadata-from-file startup-script=startup.sh

Create a target pool. A target pool allows a single access point to all the instances in a group and is necessary for load balancing in the future steps.

> gcloud compute target-pools create nginx-pool

Create a managed instance group using the instance template:

> gcloud compute instance-groups managed create nginx-group \
         --base-instance-name nginx \
         --size 2 \
         --template nginx-template \
         --target-pool nginx-pool


This creates 2 virtual machine instances with names that are prefixed with nginx-. This may take a couple of minutes.

List the compute engine instances and you should see all of the instances created:

> gcloud compute instances list

Now configure a firewall so that you can connect to the machines on port 80 via the EXTERNAL_IP addresses:

> gcloud compute firewall-rules create www-firewall --allow tcp:80

You should be able to connect to each of the instances via their external IP addresses via http://EXTERNAL_IP/ shown as the result of running the previous command.

+Create a Network Load Balancer

Network load balancing allows you to balance the load of your systems based on incoming IP protocol data, such as address, port, and protocol type. You also get some options that are not available, with HTTP(S) load balancing. For example, you can load balance additional TCP/UDP-based protocols such as SMTP traffic. And if your application is interested in TCP-connection-related characteristics, network load balancing allows your app to inspect the packets, where HTTP(S) load balancing does not.

For more information, see Setting Up Network Load Balancing.
Create an L4 network load balancer targeting your instance group:

> gcloud compute forwarding-rules create nginx-lb \
         --region us-central1 \
         --ports=80 \
         --target-pool nginx-pool


List all Google Compute Engine forwarding rules in your project.

> gcloud compute forwarding-rules list


You can then visit the load balancer from the browser http://IP_ADDRESS/ where IP_ADDRESS is the address shown as the result of running the previous command.


+Create a HTTP(s) Load Balancer

estined for your instances. You can configure URL rules that route some URLs to one set of instances and route other URLs to other instances. Requests are always routed to the instance group that is closest to the user, provided that group has enough capacity and is appropriate for the request. If the closest group does not have enough capacity, the request is sent to the closest group that does have capacity.


First, create a health check. Health checks verify that the instance is responding to HTTP or HTTPS traffic:

> gcloud compute http-health-checks create http-basic-check

Define an HTTP service and map a port name to the relevant port for the instance group. Now the load balancing service can forward traffic to the named port:

> gcloud compute instance-groups managed \
       set-named-ports nginx-group \
       --named-ports http:80

Create a backend service:
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/backendServices

> gcloud compute backend-services create nginx-backend \
      --protocol HTTP --http-health-checks http-basic-check --global

Add the instance group into the backend service:

> gcloud compute backend-services add-backend nginx-backend \
    --instance-group nginx-group \
    --instance-group-zone us-central1-a \
    --global

Create a default URL map that directs all incoming requests to all your instances:

> gcloud compute url-maps create web-map \
    --default-service nginx-backend

Create a target HTTP proxy to route requests to your URL map:

> gcloud compute target-http-proxies create http-lb-proxy \
    --url-map web-map


Create a global forwarding rule to handle and route incoming requests. A forwarding rule sends traffic to a specific target HTTP or HTTPS proxy depending on the IP address, IP protocol, and port specified. The global forwarding rule does not support multiple ports.

> gcloud compute forwarding-rules create http-content-rule \
        --global \
        --target-http-proxy http-lb-proxy \
        --ports 80


After creating the global forwarding rule, it can take several minutes for your configuration to propagate.

> gcloud compute forwarding-rules list


NAME              REGION IP_ADDRESS    IP_PROTOCOL TARGET
http-content-rule        X.X.X.X       TCP         http-lb-proxy
nginx-lb   us-central1  X.X.X.X       TCP         us-central1/....
Take note of the http-content-rule IP_ADDRESS for the forwarding rule.

From the browser, you should be able to connect to http://IP_ADDRESS/. It may take three to five minutes. If you do not connect, wait a minute then reload the browser.
